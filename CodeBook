Background & Data Source
  The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
  Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
  wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.  Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 
  3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to 
  label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected 
  for generating the training data and 30% the test data. The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by 
  applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). 
  The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass 
  filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, 
  therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by 
  calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.

Files
  'README.txt'

  'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

  'features.txt': List of all features.

  'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

  'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

  'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

  'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

  'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

Variables
  For each record it is provided:
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

Variable Units:
-Accelerometer output = rad/sec
-Gyroscope output = g/sec
-Jerk = rad/sec/sec


Data Manipulation/Processing:

Merge the training and test sets to create one data set
1) Download the zip file and unzip the contents.
2) Parse out the Training and Test data sets:
		          Data Table	     file path	
	Training:         TrainingSubject  (/subject_train.txt)
		          TrainingSetX	   (/x_train.txt)
		          TrainingLabelsY  (/y_train.txt)
	
	Test:            TestSubject     (/subject_test.txt)
		         TestSetX        (/x_test.txt)
		         TestLabelsY     (/y_test.txt)
3) Row bind the Test and Training Sets for similar topics:
	SubjectDataSet	<-	TrainingSubject + TestSubject
	XDataSet	<-	TrainingSetX + TestSetX
	YDataSet	<-	TrainingLabelsY + TestLabelsY

Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
4) Read the Features names (/features.txt)--these are the column headers for XDataSet
5) Use grep() to find Features that contain the strings "-mean()" or "-std()"

Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
6) Rename the variable names of grep() results to descriptive Features names

Appropriately label the data set with descriptive activity names.
7) Read Activity Labels and replace YDataSet values with descriptive Activity Labels
8) Rename YDataSet to "Activity"
9) Rename SubjectDataSet to "Subject"
10) Create the MasterDataSet by column binding:
	MasterDataSet	<- 	XDataSet_mean_std --XDataSet filtered to data only pertaining to mean and std deviation
			      + YDataSet	  --YDataSet replaced with descriptive Activity Labels
			      + SubjectDataSet
11) Standardize column names in MasterDataSet (make.names()) and translate invalid characters to "."
12) Use gsub() to replace abbreviated strings in the column names with more descriptive strings 

Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
13) Aggregate a final tidy dataset (TidyDataSet) and calculate mean
14) Write TidyDataSet to .txt file
